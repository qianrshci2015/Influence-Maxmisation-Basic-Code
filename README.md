# Influence-Maxmisation-Basic-Code
Basic code for influence maximization simulations with high-centrality and greedy algorithms 
This is a repository of extremely basic code for influence maximisation simulations. The programs are not written by me, and I will cite the relevant authors at a later date. I am simply compiling the code I've gathered. 
This code is for Python 3.7, and uses the following packages: networkx, ndlib, igraph
